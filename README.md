Powerful TUI for todo.txt.

## Requirements ##
otodo is written in PHP (yes, in PHP!). So you need PHP interpreter. I'm using PHP 7.2, but it should work on 7.0+. mbstring is the only required dependency.

```
apt install php-mbstring
```

It should work on almost any Unix-like system, tested on Ubuntu. 



## Installation ##
There isn't any releases, I consider master branch at Github as stable.

Just make a copy of repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/onovy/otodo.git
```

## Usage ##
Just type
```
./otodo
```

It uses default config file placed in same directory as otodo. If you want another config file just put filename as argument.

## Config ##
Whole configuration is in config.ini, there isn't any GUI for editing it. Just open your favorite editor.

## Development ##
Project is divided into few parts:
* **Config**: class for configuration loading
* **Exception**: all exception classes
* **Gui**: TUI implementation
* **ReadLine**: own Readline-like implemenation
* **Recurrent**: class for recurrent tasks parsing and handling
* **Todo**: class for parsing and generating one todo.txt line
* **Todos**: class for parsing and generating whole todo.txt file
* **TodoEx**: extended Todo class with due date and recurrent support
* **TodosEx**: extended Todos class using TodoEx
* **tests**: PHPUnit test

All pull requests are welcome.

## FAQ ##
#### Why is it written in PHP? ####
Because I speak PHP and it doesn't matter.

#### Is it possible to translate it to my language? ####
Not now but patches for localization are welcome.

#### Can I change todo.txt file when otodo is running? ####
Yes, otodo detect changes on filesystem and it's usable on multiple computers synced with Dropbox, etc. Just tune gui.reload_timeout option for pooling timer.
